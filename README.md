# ArduinoLight

## The project is done in online simulator in workwi.
## For the projet we take Arduino uno and we take LED, 2 resistor and photoresistor as components for simulation.
      ## Steps of Simulation:
        ### LED Bulb Connection:
        ### We connect anode to pin 9
        ### We connect cathode to one end of the resistor and then to GND of arduino.

    ## Photoresistor Connection:
        ### We connect LDR1:VCC to 5v of Arduino.
        ### We connect LDR1:GND to one end of the resistor and from the other end of resistor we connect to GND of Arduino.
        ### We connect LDR1:A0 to A0 of Arduino.

## After the simulation, if the ldr value is less than 250, then the light will flash and otherwise the light will be turned off as it indicates that the room will be brighter.
